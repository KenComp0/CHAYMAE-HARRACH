# FAUNA‑INSPIRED MOTION‑FIRST REACT PORTFOLIO PROMPT

You are a senior creative front‑end engineer and motion designer. Create a **Fauna‑inspired, editorial, motion‑first portfolio website** using **React** with **multiple components**. The site must prioritize **cinematic motion, sliders, masking reveals, and editorial pacing**, inspired by [https://www.thefauna.co.uk/](https://www.thefauna.co.uk/) (NOT a flashy SaaS style).

The output should be **production‑ready React code**, clearly structured, readable, and easy to customize.

## 1. CORE DESIGN PHILOSOPHY (VERY IMPORTANT)

This website must feel:

* Editorial (like a digital magazine)
* Cinematic (video, masking, slow motion)
* Minimal UI chrome
* Motion‑led, not decoration‑led
* Calm, premium, intentional

❌ Avoid:

* Neon glows
* Excessive gradients
* Gamified UI
* Fast or bouncy animations

✅ Prefer:

* Mask reveals
* Opacity fades
* Slide & clip‑path transitions
* Image → video hover transitions
* Large typography + whitespace

---

## 2. COLOR & VISUAL SYSTEM

### Color Palette

* Primary background: #0b0b0b (deep black)
* Secondary background: #111111
* Text primary: #ffffff
* Text secondary: rgba(255,255,255,0.7)
* Text tertiary: rgba(255,255,255,0.45)
* Borders: rgba(255,255,255,0.08)
* Accent: subtle off‑white or very soft blue (ONLY on hover)

### Visual Rules

* Use gradients ONLY for overlays on images/videos
* No colorful UI elements
* Black → transparent gradient masks are allowed

---

## 3. TYPOGRAPHY (EDITORIAL SCALE)

* Font family: system‑ui, sans‑serif
* H1: 96px desktop / 56px mobile – font‑weight 600 – line‑height 1.05
* H2: 64px desktop / 40px mobile
* H3: 32px
* Body text: 16–18px, line‑height 1.6
* Very few font weights
* Text should feel calm and confident

---

## 4. PROJECT STRUCTURE (MULTIPLE COMPONENTS)

Split the app into **clear React components**:

* App.jsx
* Layout.jsx
* Navbar.jsx
* Hero.jsx
* EditorialSlider.jsx (IMPORTANT)
* About.jsx
* Experience.jsx
* ProjectsSlider.jsx (IMPORTANT)
* Contact.jsx
* Footer.jsx
* useScrollProgress.js
* useIntersectionReveal.js

---

## 5. NAVIGATION (MINIMAL & EDITORIAL)

Navbar behavior:

* Fixed position
* Transparent background
* Appears on scroll (fade‑in)
* Hamburger menu on mobile
* Menu opens as a **full‑screen overlay**

Menu animation:

* Menu panel slides from bottom
* Links fade in with stagger (120ms delay)
* Background stays black

---

## 6. HERO SECTION (FAUNA‑STYLE INTRO)

Hero is **full viewport**.

Content:

* Large editorial headline
* One short subtitle line
* No buttons initially

Animation:

* On load: text reveals via **clip‑path mask**
* Opacity fade + translateY (slow)
* Optional background video or image

Scroll behavior:

* Scroll indicator (minimal line or arrow)

---

## 7. EDITORIAL SLIDER (CORE FAUNA INTERACTION)

### Component: EditorialSlider.jsx

This slider is inspired directly by Fauna’s motion language.

Slider rules:

* Full‑width
* One slide visible at a time
* Horizontal movement
* Slides transition smoothly

Each slide contains:

* Image or video
* Title
* Short description

### SLIDE TRANSITION (VERY IMPORTANT)

When navigating slides:

* Current slide masks out (clip‑path or scale X)
* Next slide masks in
* Duration: 700–900ms
* Ease: ease‑in‑out

NO bounce, NO spring.

### Hover Interaction (Desktop)

* Image fades into video preview
* Black gradient overlay appears
* Title opacity increases

---

## 8. PROJECTS SECTION (VIDEO‑FIRST)

### Component: ProjectsSlider.jsx

* Horizontal slider
* Drag or arrow navigation
* Large thumbnails

Hover behavior:

* Static image → autoplay muted video
* Overlay with project title + category
* Cursor stays default (no fancy cursor)

Entrance animation:

* Section slides in from bottom
* Child items stagger 120ms

---

## 9. SCROLL & REVEAL ANIMATIONS

### Intersection Observer

Trigger animations when 15% visible:

Initial state:

* opacity: 0
* transform: translateY(40px)

Animated state:

* opacity: 1
* transform: translateY(0)
* duration: 800–1000ms

## 10. CONFIGURATION OBJECT (CONTENT ONLY)

Create a single editable CONFIG object:

```js
const CONFIG = {
  name: "Your Name",
  role: "Your Role",
  intro: "Short editorial intro",

  projects: [
    {
      id: 1,
      title: "Project Title",
      description: "Short editorial description",
      image: "image.jpg",
      video: "preview.mp4",
      category: "Category"
    }
  ],

  experience: [
    {
      company: "Company",
      role: "Role",
      period: "Year – Year",
      description: "Editorial description"
    }
  ],

  contact: {
    email: "email@example.com",
    linkedin: "URL",
    github: "URL"
  }
}
```

## 11. ANIMATION TECH

* Use CSS transitions + transform
* Optional: Framer Motion ONLY for masking
* Prefer clip‑path, opacity, translate
* All animations GPU‑friendly

---

## 12. PERFORMANCE & ACCESSIBILITY

* Lazy load images & videos
* Muted autoplay videos only on hover
* Semantic HTML
* Keyboard navigation
* Reduced motion support

---

## 13. FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS

* Multiple React components
* Clean readable code
* Comments explaining motion logic
* No unnecessary libraries
* Editorial, Fauna‑inspired feel

The final result must feel like a **creative studio website**, not a developer portfolio.
